But why sliding pieces? The answer is that sliding pieces have so many combinations to be considered. In this paper we will make a comparison between the classical approach to obtain that and the magic bitboard approach and we will provide the reader with C++ implementation for the magic approach as we aim to provide programmers who write chess engines a discussion of one of the fastest and most versatile movebitboard generators for individual sliding pieces",
